# Electron app for panoptes subject uploading

## To build and run
```
npm run build
npm start
```

## To develop
```
npm run dev
```
You will have to reload the app after webpack is done compiling.

This will allow for react-hot-loading in development.  `eslint` with the airbnb config is included to keep the coding style consistent throughout the app.  If there is a rule you don't agree with just update the `.eslintrc` file.
